        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The effects of rosemary oil on hair growth may be seen in a month. Regular use of the oil may boost hair growth rate and hair volume. Remember not to switch between too many ingredients. Everyone’s hair is different. Hence, use in your treatments the ingredients that suit you the best (and those you are not allergic to).

          Aravi Organic Rosemary Essential Oil has a fresh, herbaceous, sweet, slightly medicinal aroma. With hints of cooling mint notes, rosemary promotes hair growth, boosts focus, and cleanses the skin.

        <!--How to use-->  
          <h3 class="text-gray-700 text-3xl title-font font-medium mb-4">How to use?</h3>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">Apply it directly to your scalp
            -Put 4-5 drops of rosemary essential oil on your scalp with the help of a dropper and gently massage it on your scalp. Massage it in circular motions to increase the blood flow in your scalp and hence, promote hair growth. Don’t apply more than 5 drops of rosemary oil as too much of it can cause your scalp to itch. Essential oils are supposed to be used in very less quantities.
            
            ➋ Mix it with another oil
            -If you feel that direct application of rosemary oil doesn’t give you enough to cover your whole scalp then you can use After mixing about 5 drops of rosemary essential oil with a teaspoon of carrier oil (Aravi Organic Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, or Almond Oil), massage evenly into your scalp after bath or shower. Rinsing out the oil afterward is optional — though if you do rinse, let the oil sit on your scalp for at least 5 to 10 minutes beforehand.
            
            ➌ Mix it into your shampoo
            -This can also apply to conditioners, lotions, or creams. Play it safe and don’t add too much. Keep to about five drops per 30 ml of product. Afterward, use the product as usual. You can also add 2 to 3 drops directly to any hair product when you apply a dollop of it on your palm before use.
