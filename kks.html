        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">WHAT IS KUMKUMADI OIL?
            Kumkumadi oil, a traditional Ayurvedic formulation, is known for its various benefits for the skin. The key ingredient that makes Kumkumadi Oil is “Kesar” or “Saffron”. Kesar, also known as “Kumkuma” in Sanskrit, is the reason behind the name Kumkumadi. 
            
            The 100% pure Kumkumadi Oil from Shankara India features a classic formulation made using Red Gold Saffron and other traditional Ayurvedic ingredients like Manjishtha and Red Sandalwood. This formulation is crafted by hand-stirring these ingredients and other natural ingredients like Sveta Chandana, Patranga, Raktachandana, Jati, Usira, etc., over a slow flame for several days. As a result, this natural micro-emulsion helps promote the skin's overall well-being. 
            
            Made using clean ingredients and free from dyes, sulphates and synthetic fragrances, the oil is suitable for all skin types, particularly dry and rough vata skin. By penetrating deep into the layers, the Kumkumadi face oil benefits the skin by moisturizing and nourishing it and reducing fine lines, thus imparting a natural and youthful glow.
            
            Below mentioned are some of the Kumkumadi Oil benefits, that will convince you to include this miraculous elixir in your skincare routine.</p>


        

          <!--Benefits-->
          <h3 class="text-gray-700 text-3xl title-font font-medium mb-4">What it includes</h3>
        <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">1. Helps Attain Even Skin Tone

            The primary ingredient in Kumkumadi oil is saffron, which has always been known in Ayurveda for its skin-brightening properties. But it's not only saffron that should be lauded for Kumkumadi Oil for face benefits; the amalgamation of other herbs like Majishtha and Red Sandalwood improves the potency of this oil by enriching it with antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Regularly applying 100% pure Kumkumadi face oil from Shankara India helps diminish dark spots, blemishes, and uneven skin tone and gives you a radiant look.
            
             2. Provides Deep Hydration
            
            It feels good when the skin isn't tight, dry or scaly. Dry skin also leads to a faster appearance of wrinkles, fine lines and other signs of ageing. Unlike conventional moisturisers, Kumkumadi oil penetrates deep into the skin layers and delivers intense hydration without clogging pores. It replenishes lost moisture, leaving the skin soft, supple, and rejuvenated.
            
            3. Anti-Ageing Wonder
            
            If you're following a thorough skin care regimen and still struggling with evident ageing signs, you might need Kumkumadi oil in your routine. The presence of Red Sandalwood in the oil helps clear whiteheads and blackheads while tightening the enlarged pores, all of which lead to dull and wrinkled skin.
            
            4. Heals Acne
            
            The anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties of Saffron Red Gold and Manjishtha present in Kumkumadi Face oil help reduce acne and inflammation. By working as a cleanser, the oil helps prevent clogged pores caused by sheds of dead skin cells, dirt and grime, thus giving you a clear and acne-free skin.
            
            5. Calms Inflammation
            
            For those struggling with inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema or rosacea, Kumkumadi Oil offers soothing relief. Its anti-inflammatory properties calm redness, irritation, and swelling and restore pH balance in sensitive skin.
